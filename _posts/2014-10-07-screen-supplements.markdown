> 国庆假期马上走到终点，最后两天找了些电影打发时间，看到些有感触的桥段和独白，略为记录，带些随笔，以充拾遗。

* 《Phone Booth》--狙击电话亭
* I've never done anything for anybody who couldn't do something for me. I string along a kid with promises that I'll pay him money. I keep him around because he looks up to me.Adam,if you're watching,don't be a publicist. You're too good for it.
* I lie in person,and on the phone I lie to my friends.I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people. I'm just part of a big cycle of lies.I should be fucking president.I wear all this Italian shit because underneath,I still feel like the Bronx. I think I need these clothes,and this watch. My $2000 watch is a fake,and so am I. I neglected the things I should've valued most. I valued this shit.
* I take off my wedding ring to call Pam. Kelly,that's Pam. Don't blame her. I never told her if I was married,and if I did she...she would've told me to go home. Kelly,looking at you now,I'm ashamed of myself. I mean,I work so hard on this image,on Stu Shepard,the asshole who refers to himself in third person,that I only proved I should be alone. I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long...I'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath. But here I am. I'm just flesh and blood and weakness. I love you so fucking much. I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.And,I don't wanna give you up. I wanna make things better,but it may not be my choice anymore. You deserve better.

## 正文

电影是真的挺好看，这段“confess”发生在电影情节最紧张激昂的末尾。没有情节的铺垫看起来确实有些无趣，还有那个刻意的英文单词，其实我想强行讨论下罪感文化耻感文化啥的，不过想想这俩概念我自己都迷迷蒙蒙，就还是算了。

电影的男主角在自我和亲人的生命受到极大威胁的情况下做出的忏悔与告白，所刻画的形象与表达的价值观念可以透过屏幕给我带来几分感动。"Italian suit"和"fake watch"所搭建起的"the image"，就像《搏击俱乐部》里Jack精致的公寓，昂贵的家具，太极图案的咖啡桌。The things you own end up owning you.当这个油滑的掮客在枪口的威胁之下认识到真正的自我，就像双手离开方向盘的驾驶员，车也许会倾覆，但新的体验随之悄然而至。最后关于爱的表白更是可以撩起我深处的柔软啊。"You deserve better."这种话真是可以在自卑如我这等人的心中打出成吨的虚区。

## 后记

最后的最后，一开始看这片子，我还以为会有一个水区”双妻侠“式的结尾。。爱情观已经被大漩涡彻底颠覆了啊！！！
